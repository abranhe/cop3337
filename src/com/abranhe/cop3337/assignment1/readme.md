## Assignment 1

In the 17th century, the discipline of probability theory got its start when a gambler asked a
mathematician friend to explain some observations about dice games. Why did he, on average,
lose a bet that at least one six would appear when rolling a die four times? And why did he
seem to win a similar bet, getting at least one double six when rolling a pair of dice 24 times?

Nowadays, it seems astounding that any person would roll a pair of dice 24 times in a row, and
then repeat that many times over. Letâ€™s do that experiment on a computer instead. Simulate
each game a million times and print out the wins and losses.

program working.
 - The GameSimulator class is where you write your code. Please fill in all the code where
it is indicated.
