## Assignment 8

Phone numbers and PIN codes can be easier to remember when you find words that spell out the number on a standard phone pad. For example, instead of remembering the combination `5282`, you can just think of JAVA.

Write a recursive method that given a number, yields all possible spellings (which may or may not be real words).

Please use the file included as a starting point.

Possible testing values are:

```
5282
26678837
7764726
```
